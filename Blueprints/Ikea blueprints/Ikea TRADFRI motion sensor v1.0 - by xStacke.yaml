      description: "Time to leave the light on after last motion is detected. Make sure you take into account the lockout of your selected motion sensor. Example: IKEA Tradfri has a 3 minute lockout timer, if lights go off before the 3 minutes are over, they cannot be turned on by motion until the lockout window of 3 minutes has passed. Time seems to vary for my devices so feel free to experiment with this."
